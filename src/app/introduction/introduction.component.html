<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>ACS Consulting needs a small application that can calculate a department and/or managerâ€™s monthly expense
allocation based on the number and types of employees reporting to the manager or contained within the department.</p>

<h3>Specific Requirements</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Developers warrant an allocation of $1000 each.</li>
  <li>QA Testers warrant an allocation of $500 each.</li>
  <li>Managers warrant an allocation of $300 each.</li>
  <li>Managers can have QA Testers, Developers and other managers report to them.</li>
  <li>Departments consist of any kinds of employees.</li>
  <li>Users of this application should be able to:
    <ol>
      <li>Determine the monthly expense allocation warranted a manager        who has various employee types reporting to him/her at least        two levels deep (Manager -> Manager -> Developer). The
          level of depth of the hierarchy should be flexible ideally.
      </li>
      <li>Determine the monthly expense allocation warranted a department with various employee types under it at multiple levels deep just as the Manager can.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Example Scenario</h3>
<ul>
  <li>For the given hierarchy:-
    <ul>
      <li>Manager A
        <ul>
          <li>Manager B
            <ul>
              <li>Developer</li>
              <li>QA Tester</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Manager A's allocation should be: $2100</li>
</ul>
